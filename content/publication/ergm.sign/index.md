abstract: |
    The ergm.sign package is an implementation of the exponential random graph model
    (ERGM) for signed networks. It builds on the statnet packages and provides the ability
    to fit an ERGM to static signed networks or a temporal exponential random graph model
    (TERGM) to dynamic signed networks. It also includes functions for the descriptive
    analysis, simulation, and evaluation of the model fit. In this paper, we illustrate the
    signed exponential random graph model and its implementation in the ergm.sign package
    using data on tribal and rebel conflicts.
